Description: Multi-label Classification model for a Hotel booking app.
Goal: To classify the reviews as Positive or Negative and further identifying them as reviews on 4
important categories (Room, Staff and Service, Amenities, Food).
Synopsis:
 This model helped the client in identifying whether the review was positive or negative and also for
which category the review was given. For example, if it was a positive review, the model would
identify whether it is on food, staff and service, amenities or room.
 A combination of Text mining and supervised classification algorithm was used in a pipeline
method.
 NuSVC was the highest performing algorithm after “K-fold” cross validation for binary classification.
 Conv 1D was the highest performing algorithm for multi label classification.
 “F1 micro” score, along with “Hamming loss” was considered as the evaluation metrics.
Tools/Technique: Python, Feature Engineering, Text mining, t-SNE,LSTM, Conv 1D .
